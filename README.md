# Requirements:
###### 1.Google Colab
###### 2.Keras.models
###### 3.Keras
###### 4.Numpy

# Dataset:
I used MNIST dataset. The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST (it's copied from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing handwriting digits.I used Gaussian Navie Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms for this phase.
